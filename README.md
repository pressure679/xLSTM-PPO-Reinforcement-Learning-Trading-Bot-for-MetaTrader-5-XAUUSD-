# xLSTM PPO Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot for MetaTrader 5 (XAUUSD)

An AI-powered trading bot that combines **Extended LSTM (xLSTM)** and **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to learn profitable trading strategies on XAUUSD.

Unlike traditional indicator-based Expert Advisors, this project learns directly from historical market data using reinforcement learning while incorporating Smart Money Concepts (SMC), technical indicators, market structure, and adaptive risk management.

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pressure679/LSTM-PPO-Reinforcement-Learning-Trading-Bot-for-MetaTrader-5-XAUUSD-
cd LSTM-PPO-Reinforcement-Learning-Trading-Bot-for-MetaTrader-5-XAUUSD-
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- MetaTrader 5

Python packages:

```
torch
stable-baselines3
sb3-contrib
gymnasium
MetaTrader5
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
ta
xlstm
```

---

## Historical Data

Place historical data inside the `download/` folder.

Example:

```
download/
└── xauusd-m5-bid-2023-01-01-2026-06-01.csv
```

The bot automatically calculates all technical indicators and Smart Money Concept features before training.

---

## Training

Train the reinforcement learning model:

```bash
python bot.py --train
```

Training automatically:

- Loads historical data
- Calculates technical indicators
- Builds SMC features
- Normalizes inputs
- Creates the trading environment
- Trains the PPO agent
- Saves the trained model

---

## Live Trading

Run the live trading bot:

```bash
python bot.py --test
```

The bot will:

- Connect to MetaTrader 5
- Read live candles
- Generate feature vectors
- Predict actions
- Execute trades
- Manage open positions automatically
